extra tools for handling catalogue:

- diy parameterised by bell

- herd+diy to be married to a constraint solver, e.g. alloy:
    . to generate counter-examples to cat file (e.g. examples in Viktor's POPL 15 C++ paper)
    . to compare models (e.g. take intersection of two cat files then generate
      counter-examples to intersection by step just above)
    . to check DRF => SC for example (e.g. drf.cat containing 'undefined_unless
      empty dr' intersected with 'sc.cat')

- jingle: simple translation tool from bell litmus tests to concrete syntax
  (e.g. java, opencl etc) 

- nuit: compilation mappings as functions over cat files

- regression script (see Nathan's C++ setup) to run tests/ against cats/ and
  check results w.r.t.  allowed/observed files
