Modification of teh cat language

* Allow ~testname as a test, the effect is to negate test outcome,
  e.g. ~acyclic is true for cyclic relations.
        
  Hence test syntax now is
   test_name: acyclic|~acyclic|empty|~empty|irreflexive|~irreflexive
   test: expr (as name)?

* New 'flag' construct, test syntax is
   new_test:
   | test --> as before
   | undefined_unless test -> as before
   | flag test ->
      the test must have a name, and this name is execution is
      recorded as having flagged the name, when the test evaluates to true.
      *Notice* as in the  undefined_unless case, flagged tests
      never abort model execution.
