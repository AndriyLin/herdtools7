  * Suppress deprecaton warnings, by writing code in misc...
7.17

    (replace condition on shared location by specific register, because
     of "last write" problem)
7.13
  * <correct> mrcu (check that call[sync] L...U ran at most once.
7.12
  * tools added mrcu (for rcu translation) => add "filter" component to tests.
7.11
  * tools: correct mcmp (normalize_simple in logState), so as to accept
           flowing model output.
  * tools: add mshowhashes to list test hashes + share code with mdiag
7.10
  * Correct bug in computing ne (not equal): was 1 (true) for two different
    "S" vars...
7.09

  * All lexers, ignore '\r'.
  * CAT: make the initial "identity" string optional.
7.08

7.07
  * herd: set 'Atom' -> set 'X' (compatibility)
7.06

7.04
7.03
7.02

7.01

  * litmus:  Refactoring: avoid mutable internal flags.

  
5.01 Release

    (Android Debugging Bridge)

5.00 Release
   * gen: Added classify tool
   * gen: Uniform naming scheme, clarify usage and document
   * gen: Refactor diyone second mode, in the same style as diy/diycross
   * gen: Support for atomic accesses (undocumented)

  * litmus:  New user synchronisation mode userfence (suggested by Javi Merino)
  * litmus:  More POSIX compliant code in two occasions (malloc/errno and
    use thread level affinity functions, suggested by Javi Merino)
  * litmus:  Runtime option +fix, to cancel out changing launch mode
  * litmus:  Make timebase delay settable (option -delay)
  * litmus:  Timebase synchronisation mode (-barrier timebase).
  * litmus:  option -crossrun <host> -> run.sh run executables on distant machine <host>.
  * litmus:  add -stride mode (memory scanned by increments > 1), useful ? Very useful.
  * litmus:  -linkopt option

  * litmus:  -gcc option
  * litmus:  ARM and cortex9 (cross-compilation) configuration files

4.00 Release
   * gen: ARM support.
   * gen: Generalize -o option, as for litmus.
   * gen: option -var for diycross for nice variables.,
   * gen: new tool diycross, similar to diyvar, but let user
     specify  the list of alternatives eg:
     diycross -name SB PodWR,SyncdWR Fre PodWR,SyncdWR Fre
     For 3 MP-like tests (MP, MP+sync+po, MP+syncs)
     diyvar behavior is still here with the pseudo-relaxation all(R|W)(R|W)
     eg: diycross -name SB allWR Fre allWR Fre
   * gen: Add a new functionality for diyone: generate tests from a list
     of cycles given in stdin.
   * Mode precise edge dependencies, DpdR, DpdW, CltrdR, CtrldW
     are still recognised by parser and are default values
     (backward compatibility).
     However, Dpd* and Ctrld* are not available anymore.
   * gen: dont: uncompress archive with gunzip (AIX: tar z.. not accepted)
   * gen: diy: -cumul false also acts on RfStar

    detects available logical processors.

  * litmus:  added chianti config file
  * litmus:  added vargas16 config file
  * litmus:  -o name.tgz produce compressed archives

  * litmus:  added the -no <cyclelist> option (used by dont).

2.99 Release (beta)

   * gen: Introduce dont, for automating testing.
   * gen: Additional mode for diy: critical, for generating critical cycles
     (no Po/Po consing)
   * gen: Additional option for diy: -cumul, for avoiding ambiguous tests.

2.00 Release

   * gen: -mix option (default false, for backward compatibility)
   * gen: Clarification of observers and documentation
     [three modes accept/avoid/force, three sorts straight/fenced/loop]
     Defaults avoid/fenced.
   * gen: Added PPO pseudo-relaxation, very ad-hoc.
