** Interpreter recursive call for boolean result.

rev 433 introduces polymorphic sets to solve issue. Environemnts are purged
from polymorphic Kont values before using them in call. However,
the purge is not complete, as it dos not apply to closure environements,
not to ocaml level environments in frozen lazy expressions.

rev 432 used an existential type.

No solution is 100% type safe, but I guess that both solutions
would probably catch all (ocaml, typing) violations (try to make one!)
as runtime errors of some kind or other.
